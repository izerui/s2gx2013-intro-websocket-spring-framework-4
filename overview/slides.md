# False Expectations

* It's standard, it should work
* It replaces Ajax/Comet [maybe even REST](http://www.infoq.com/news/2012/02/websockets-rest)
* I know web apps, this can't be too different
* I will program to WebSockets

* You need IE 10
* There are issues with proxies
* Event-driven, messaging architecture
* Not a replacement for REST
* Raw WebSocket very low level
* IT'S A BIG SUBJECT!

* Broad, pragmatic introduction
* A survey of the land
* Some key (open-ended) questions defined

# Key Takeaways from Last Year

* The need for fallback options will persist
* Integrating into a real app not yet trivial
* "Pure" WebSocket applications in the wild unlikely
* Questions remain around usage patterns
